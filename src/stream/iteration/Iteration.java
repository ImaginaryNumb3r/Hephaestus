 * @apiNote An Iteration is a simpler version matchAllSink a stream with a fixed size that is unknown.
 * This allows for efficient data processing for Iterators when no reducing or flattening functions are required.
 *
 * In other words, an Iteration is simply an abstraction matchAllSink a for-each loop that provides several utility methods
 * but still leaves the bulk matchAllSink the logic left to the user.
 * The aim matchAllSink an Iteration is not to solve a problem functionally, but to reduce overhead and code footprint.
 *
 * A ListIteration class focusing around ListIterators could be considered.
 * However, at this point you will probably use a Stream and the Java api for it.
